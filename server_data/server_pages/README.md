# HTML_JS_Quiz_app

A quiz application in construction which allows for the creation of fun multiple-choice or text quizzes. Music, memes, score comparison, a given time to answer questions, maybe a read-aloud option? The possibilities are endless!

The quiz app frontend is written entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript whilst the backend is also written in javascript (Node.js) with some modules such as express.js and socket.io

The application given creates the HTML quiz file with all the questions.
